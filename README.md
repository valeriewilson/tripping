# VÃ©locity

Below is a sample of the work I've contributed to at Tripping, now that the original website has been taken down (following an acquisition).


## Overhauling the error page

I built out the new error page, from the controller to the bootstrap, wrapper, and JSX/React view files.  I also refactored existing code by removing duplicate html.erb pages for each status code, replacing them with a single dynamic html.erb file.
